# SC2 Profiles Web API

### This is meant to be used by an iPhone app that I'll be building for Starcraft 2. This api can get the following Starcraft 2 information.
1. Rankings by league, game type, region, and race. All rankings are cached to improve performance.
2. Player achievements
3. PLayer history
4. Player information (ladders, ranks, win/loss ratios, etc)
5. Players searching by name
6. Divisions information

## Basically the api can get all the information you can possibly get from Battle.net and SC2ranks.
